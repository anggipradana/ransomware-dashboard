Jubilee Jobs programs offers hope for jobseekers all over Washington, DC as they strive to overcome often extensive barriers that result from unemployment, learning disabilities, former incarceration, and alcohol/substance abuse. Some individuals desire to leave behind reliance on public subsidies. Others start with little work experience, large gaps in work history, communication or language barriers, low education or weak job proficiency. Jubilee Jobs sees beyond these circumstances and assists every applicant as they take steps toward a better life. At Jubilee Jobs, we pride ourselves on encouraging every applicant throughout the entire job process. The process begins with initial meetings with job counselors, moves to workshops (interviewing skills, conflict resolution, goal-setting) and ends with the individual obtaining a job.\r Employees: 32\r Revenue:$5 Million\r Industry: Business Services\r Downloaded: 10GB\r Phone Number:(202) 667-8970",
